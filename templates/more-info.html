    <p>
        Our cancellation policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.
        <b>There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted:  </b>
        Cancellations made within 7 days prior of the tour/rental date will be subject to non-refundable cancellation fee, 15% of the total tour/rental value. The remaining 85% of the tour/rental booking will be refunded to your account.
        Cancellations made within 48 hours of the tour/rental time will not be refunded and are subject to a 100% charge of the tour/rental price. Guest who are absent or do not show up for the booking are subject to a 100% charge.
        <h4>Sale items:</h4>

        To request a refund, we require a receipt or proof of purchase with confirmation number to be emailed to <a href="mailto:info@ablsoution.com" target="_top">info@ablsoution.com</a>
        Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer/tour/rental provider.
        Upon receiving your request for a refund, ABL will notify you within 48 hours with the approval or rejection of your refund. <br>
        If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.
        <h4>Late or missing refunds (if applicable):</h4>
        If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.
        Then contact your credit card company. It may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
        Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
        If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at info@ablsolution.com.
        <h4>Exchanges (if applicable):</h4>
        We only replace items if they are defective or damaged.  If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at info@ablsolution.com and send your item to: <b>190 Oxford Rd. Trail BC, Canada V1R 2J3</b>
        <h4>Gifts:</h4>
        If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.
        If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and he/she will find out about your return.

        If you are shipping an item over $75, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.<br><br>
